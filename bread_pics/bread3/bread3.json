                            "Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture. You have decided to go against everything the bread stands for and burn it to a crisp. This poor baguette had no chance at life, and you burnt it like a fucking savage. Think about how much went into the dough, the time it took to rise, etc. NICE JOB."]
